## Usage
First, install `yarn` by following the instructions on their [site](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

Then, from the root directory, start the development server:

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

Your browser will open `localhost:1234` if the build was successful. It will also automatically reload when changes are made to files within the `src` directory.
